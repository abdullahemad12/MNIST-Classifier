# MNIST Dataset classifier

a Neural network that classifies the famous MNIST dataset implemented in python. The implementation makes use of only two python libraries:

1. Numpy 
2. Matplotlib

# Running the code

Running the code is very simple. first you need to clone this repository and then execute the following line in the terminal after navigating to the directory of the source code:

`python main.py`  


# Extra notes 

the MNIST is fetched using sklearn library in the main.py file and will be downloaded to a directory in the same folder with the name "dataset". Make sure you create a new folder and name it "dataset" before running the above line in the terminal
